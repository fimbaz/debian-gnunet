Description: extracts meta-data from files of arbitrary type (library)
 GNU libextractor provides developers of file-sharing networks, file managers,
 and WWW-indexing bots with a universal library to obtain meta-data about files.
 .
 Currently, libextractor supports the following formats: HTML, PDF, PS, OLE2
 (DOC, XLS, PPT), OpenOffice (sxw), StarOffice (sdw), DVI, MAN, MKV, MP3 (ID3v1
 and ID3v2), OGG, WAV, EXIV2, JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, DEB, RPM, TAR(.GZ), ZIP,
 ELF, REAL, RIFF (AVI), MPEG, QT and ASF.
 .
 Also, various additional MIME types are detected. It can also be used to
 compute hash functions (SHA-1, MD5, ripemd160).
 .
 This package contains the library and all plugins, except EXIV2, MPEG, OGG,
 OLE2 and thumbail - they are splittet out to libextractor-plugins.
